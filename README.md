# mdjs-entry-creator

## Purpose

This project is a node re-write of my moneydance-entry-creator project, which was written
in Java.  I wanted to try an write this in Node.js to try something new.

## Setup

I recommend using `nvm` to install and manage node.js versions.  There is a `.nvmrc` file
that specifies the version of node.js to use.  Run the this via the command line to install
the correct version of node.js

```bash
nvm install <version from .nvmrc>
```

Once installed, run

```bash
nvm use <version from .nvmrc>
```

## Testing

Run 

```bash
npm test
```
 to run the tests

## Usage

On the command line, run 

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the application and print out the parameters you can use with the program.
